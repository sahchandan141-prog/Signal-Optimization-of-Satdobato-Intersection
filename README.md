# Signal-Optimization-of-Satdobato-Intersection
Conducted a comprehensive traffic engineering study of a four-legged signalized intersection in Lalitpur, including traffic volume surveys, vehicle classification, PCU conversion, and geometric data collection. Evaluated intersection performance using control delay and Level of Service (LOS) in accordance with HCM guidelines and developed microsimulation models using SIDRA Intersection 8.0 to optimize signal cycle length, phase splits, and left-turn control strategies, resulting in reduced control delays on selected approaches. Applied AutoCAD for basic layout drafting and MS Excel for data analysis and reporting, gaining hands-on experience in traffic modeling, signal timing design, field data collection (manual and CCTV-based), technical documentation, and analytical problem-solving.
